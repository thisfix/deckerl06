This is optional replacement for Assignment 7 or alternative to it. It is based on using the solution for assignment 6. 

Provide the following implements of error checking
- When name is set for employee which includes all types, verify that its not null or "" and throw IllegalArgumentException if so

- setCurrentSales, setHourlyRate, setCurrentHours methods of all types, check that its not zero or negative, 
throw IllegalArgumentException

- setCommissionRate, setCurrentLibrarianUsedBookTotals, setBasePay, setCurrentLibraryUsedBookSalesTotals, 
check to make sure not zero or negative, throw IllegalArgumentException

- Library, libraryNumber is negative or zero throw IllegalArgumentException

- processPayroll throws LibraryException if a CommissionedEmployee's commissionRate is > 100% and includes the Employee object in 
the LibraryException. Add getCommissionRate method on CommissionedEmployee interface.

- processPayroll/getCurrentUsedBookSales throws new LibraryException if no employees are staffed in the store.

- getTotalCommissions throws new LibraryCommissionException if total is zero or negative. contains the total in the exception

Define a new Exception Class called LibraryException, that has one property of type CommissionedEmployee. Also, has a get method 
for this property.

Define a new Exception Class called LibraryCommissionException, it has one property of type double containing the commission totals.

In the LibraryTest class validate all the above including positive tests. Example, set libraryNumber to 1 and test should pass. 
no exception.

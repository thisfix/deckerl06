Questions:
How does inheritance break encapsulation? 
	Inheriting from a class gives the subclass as much access as possible as specified by the access modifiers.  
	This violates whatever encapsulation was intended for the class.
What are static and dynamic types and how are they different?
	a static type is a type that is defined upon declaration and doesn't need to be initialized
	e.g. String myName;
	a dynamic type is a type that doesn't need to be defined upon declaration but must be initialized
	e.g. myName = "Luke";
